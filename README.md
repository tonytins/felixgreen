## Premise

Felix Green is a story about the titular character. He becomes cyborg after losing his arm and eye in a car accident. But just as he is beginning to settle down, the military knocks on his door and explain that they're interested in using him to gain the upper hand in future warfare. But Felix is still recovering from the trauma, yet he knows can be of value.
